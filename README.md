# yardi-takehome

This is my Yardi Interview take-home project

I built the interface with Bootstrap 5 markup and added a few interactive elements with vanilla JS

Throughout the files:

    index.html, styles.css, and index.js

    I have included code comments to hopefully make the sections and intentions a little more clear.
    I also included mental asides on parts I found confusing or struggled with or where Im uncertain of best practices

Currently, I am stopping short in my attempt to add a feature that is probably slightly unnecessary for the scope of this project.
I was trying to add a resize Observer to listen to the changes in the progressbar widths
-- this is only partially functional right now.

\*\*\* you can demo it by clicking on the settings button -- whcich will increment/decriment the widths of the progressbars for testing purposes!

Thank you for a wonderful interview last week. I hope my code will be helpful in your evaluation!

Sincerely,

Sonam Zahrt-Tenzin

P.S.
I am going to work through the night and send a finished version in the morning, including a link to my portfolio site where a live demo of this project will be available for you.
